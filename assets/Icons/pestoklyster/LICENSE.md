**Dogecoin icon set 1.0**

These icons are interpretations of the *official* Dogecoin icon and are by no means replacements.

All icons are available in standard Windows/Mac OS sizes in PNG, PSD & ICO/ICNS formats.

The Doge illustration used is made by reddit.com/u/oebro.

Further development:
* Adding all iOS & Android sizes
* Adding a vector version (Photoshop smart object) for scaling.

All icons are free to use for any purpose (except evil) but please include the read me.
